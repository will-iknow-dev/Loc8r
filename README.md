-Error when inputing meta tag.
--meta is self closing and should not have content.

-Changes
-- In this step alot has changed, we've added bootstap distro for a front-end framework. We have also included jquery as it is necessary for the bootstrap libs.

--In addition we have put our app onto heroku so that we have a production presentational build to view changes locally and live in production.

-The rules of a REST API
--REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer, which is an architectural style rather than a strict protocol. REST is stateless--It has no idea of any current user state or history.
--API is an abbreviation for application program interface, which enables applications to talk to each other.
